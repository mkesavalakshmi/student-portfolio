    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br><br>

    <p>
        Hello! I’m Kesava Lakshmi, a passionate web developer currently pursuing my diploma final year. 
        I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        I started my journey by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later, I expanded my knowledge 
        into Python and SQL for backend development. Right now, I am also learning React to build 
        modern and dynamic web applications.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        I improve my skills by creating real-world projects like portfolio websites, business websites, 
        and data dashboards using Tableau. I believe in continuous learning and practicing every day 
        to become better in web development.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        My goal is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer and work on meaningful projects 
        that solve real-world problems.
